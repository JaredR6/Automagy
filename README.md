Automagy
========

This is a fan attempt at recreating Automagy for Thaumcraft 6. More general information and download links for the original mod for Thaumcraft 4 and 5 can be found on [the Minecraft Forum thread](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/2125369-tc4-5-addon-automagy-automation-and-logistics-v2).

**This branch is for the _Automagy 3.x_ versions for Minecraft 1.12.2 (Thaumcraft 6 Beta).**

Localization sources: 

**[_Automagy 0.x_ for Minecraft 1.7.10 (Thaumcraft 4.2)](https://github.com/Tuhljin/Automagy).**

**[_Automagy 2.x_ for Minecraft 1.8.9 (Thaumcraft 5)](https://github.com/Tuhljin/Automagy/tree/1.8.9).**

## Contributing

Feel free to support the project with fixes, updates or anything related to porting functionality! New features are unplanned, for now.  
I only ask that you preserve as much as the current code as you can, and that large modifications have full compatibility.
